<strong>About this site</strong><br><br>
This website is a restored version of my original homepage from the late 1990s.<br>
For some reason — perhaps instinctively — I saved the entire site on a CD nearly 30 years ago.<br>
Recently I rediscovered it and decided to bring it back online, more or less as it once was.<br><br>
It is presented as a small digital time capsule from the early days of the web —<br>
when pages blinked, counters mattered, and everything felt a little experimental.<br><br>
Please note that some links may be outdated or temporarily broken.<br>
I update and repair things when I have the time and inspiration to do so.<br>
This restoration is an ongoing project and also a nostalgic revisit to another era.
