a time for everyone... <br>
</font></b>When you want to move on. Then you are looking for advice for whatever,&nbsp;<br>
- knowing that the Internet is full of it! But, for the moment, you just can't
find it!<br>
There is a wide and wild world out here with a lot of dedicated people who will
help you for FREE!<br>
Just remember that before you start paying for it.&nbsp;<br>
 I've been around since 1996 and in my opinion there is a struggle going on&nbsp;<br>
between those who is trying to make money on the net<br>
and those who wants it to be a FREE source for communication and information.<br>
So far, the only business making any serious money, is the porn industry.<br>
The rest of them is mainly exchanging banners for advertising.<br>
The motto still stands: &quot;Information needs to be FREE&quot;!</font></p>

contribution to that motto. The rest is on <a href="mymind.htm"> my mind</a>..</font></p>
