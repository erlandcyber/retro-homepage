\# Retro Homepage of Erland Wicklund



This repository contains a restored version of my original homepage from the late 1990s.  

For some reason — perhaps instinctively — I saved the entire site on a CD nearly 30 years ago. Recently I rediscovered it and decided to bring it back online, more or less as it once was.



The site is intended as a small \*\*digital time capsule\*\* from the early days of the web — when pages blinked, counters mattered, and everything felt experimental and playful.



\## Structure



\- `index.htm` – Main landing page

\- `aboutme.htm` – About me page

\- `contact.htm` – Contact page

\- `construc.htm` – Under construction page

\- `images/` – Folder containing all images

\- `audio/` – Folder containing MP3 and WAV files used on the site

\- `animated/` – Folder containing GIF animations



> \*\*Note:\*\* Some links may be outdated or temporarily broken. Updates will be made when time and inspiration allow.  



Enjoy exploring this little piece of web history!
