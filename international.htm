<p>– Part 1 documents the beginning of a long-term cultural and technical initiative in Luanda, Angola, focused on building a small, sustainable music studio and training local sound technicians.</p>

<p>Through Kontaktnätet (The Network for Non-Commercial Culture), a music studio was developed based on a 4-channel portable recording system (“porta studio”). The project aimed to support local music production by providing both equipment and hands-on technical education.</p>

<p>This first part covers the initial study visit and presents a documentary portrait of Angola at the time, highlighting the social, cultural, and technical conditions that shaped the project. The film was originally created to gain support for the initiative and to help secure technical resources.</p>

<p>The Porta Project was active between 1987 and 1992, including three journeys to Angola:</p>

<p>
An initial study visit together with representatives from Swedish youth organizations<br>
Construction of the music studio in collaboration with local participants<br>
Training of sound technicians to independently operate the studio
</p>

<p>Part 1 focuses on the start of the project, the study visit, and the broader context in which the work was carried out.</p>
